-   Reviewed Character Map Pattern
    - Uses objects to collect values/frequencies of values.
    - Useful for avoiding nested loops with arrays/strings.
    - Ex. Anagrams, SameArray, MaxChar


-   Reviewed Multiple Pointers Pattern
    - Achieved by creating pointer variables that correspond to an index to move towards the beginning, middle, or end based on a condition.
    - Very efficient for solving problems with minimal space complexity.
    - Only works when an array/string is sorted.
    - Ex. SumZero, CountUnique


-   Reviewed Divide and Conquer
    - Divide a data set into smaller chunks and then repeat that process with a subset of data.
    - For example, if you have an array and need to find a value, you can keep breaking it in half to search.
    - The pattern may significantly decreases time complexity.

-   Reviewed Sliding Window Pattern
    - Create a window which can either be an array or number from one position to another.
    - Window size may either increase or close, in which case a new window is created.
    - Useful for keeping track of a subset of data inside an array/string.
    - Ex. MaxSubArray

# October 20
    - Worked on anyDuplicates questions using both the charMap method and pointer method.
        - Feeling good about charMaps, but pointer method needs work.
    - Started Recursion Module
        - As functions are invoked, they are added to the top of the call stack.
        - They are popped off one at a time from the top as they are completed.
    - Practiced Two Pointer method w/ isSubsequence. Was able to figure it out on my own but took a while.
    - May want to work more on sliding windows tomorrow.

# October 21
    - Finish Recursion module
    - Learn about Linear Search and Binary Search
    - Struggled a little bit with recursion - power.js, but did well with factorial and productOfArray.
    - Reviewed Two-Pointers and Sliding Windows

# October 22
    - Practice Frequency Counter and Two Pointer problems.
